                        light chitchat is fine in most channels, but please keep
                        general discussions outside this server. We have a few
                        other related servers listed in #info.

                        other language, so please keep your conversation in
                        English. Media of other languages are fine, as long as
                        they abide by all the rules.

                        Just a Twitter or Pixiv link is fine. If you really
                        can&apos;t find the source, at least don&apos;t claim it
                        as your own work. And no, Pinterest links don&apos;t
                        help, unfortunately.
